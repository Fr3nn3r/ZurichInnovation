Q: How will my submission be tested?
A: New submissions will be tested using a small sample of things provided for processing through your tool.

Q: What will the file or e-mail formatting be like in the final dataset?
A: The data is synthesized and anonymized into text files, which should resemble the format of their original documents.

Q: How much human interaction with the system is expected?
A: Minimized human intervention is anticipated, and it's acceptable if the AI processes from submission intake till premium calculation without human input.

Q: Is there a different scoring for creating extra features?
A: The primary requirement is meeting the use case requirements. However, additional benefits useful to underwriters are open for consideration.

Q: What is the overall scoring criteria?
