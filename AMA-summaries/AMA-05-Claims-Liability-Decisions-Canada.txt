The core goal: **build a system** that:

1. Calculates loss cost
2. Compares it against policy coverage
3. Determines fault percentage
4. Estimates reserve — nothing more, nothing less.

## 🛠 Data & Documents

* Use **anonymized real‑life cases**, primarily PDFs and email bodies (some scanned, some handwritten).
* Shared documents include: first‑notice claims, police reports, medical records, invoices, etc.
* **For fault in provided cases: always 100%** — no split liability yet, though those are coming.
* COIs (certificates of insurance) & policy terms: present but may be embedded/missing in some cases—team is working on better quality data.

## ❓Key Questions & Answers

### 1. **Scope – No Active Checks**

* No checking for “active customer” or matching open claims.
* Just cost → coverage → fault → reserve.

### 2. **External Reference Use**

* Weather, scene, context—yes, investigators include that in real life.
* **But** for use‑case: assume all provided information is already verified, so external lookup not needed.

### 3. **Document Upload**

* No user‑upload flows needed.
* The system only flags “insufficient data” cases; subsequent information retrieval & reprocessing is out of scope.

### 4. **Insufficient Data Handling**

* At *any point* (cause, coverage, fault, quantum) if data is insufficient → trigger “insufficient data.”
* No need to maintain state; resubmitted data *may* trigger re-start or resume—left open.

### 5. **Fault % Decision**

* Ideally, the system estimates fault %.
* If not possible, assume 100% fault.
* Shared cases currently don’t include splits; more coming later.

### 6. **Minimum & Sufficiency Criteria**

* Must have **basic registration data** (e.g. date of loss).
* Beyond that, sufficiency depends on the specific claim.
* No fixed checklist beyond that “minimum set.”

### 7. **Data Delivery**

* Currently via email (attachments).
* Team is working on improving data format (more structured, easier to work with).

### 8. **Timelines & Guidance**

* Next dataset release is “soon” but no firm date yet.
* Training materials and internal guidelines may be available — team to confirm.

### 9. **Human‑in‑the‑Loop**

* Final decisions always human-reviewed.
* But automated steps (coverage check, email reminders, estimation) are encouraged for efficiency.

### 10. **Fraud & Litigation**

* **Fraud detection is out of scope** (assume truthfulness).
* Loss estimate → reserve calculation is within scope. Litigation risk isn’t explicitly handled.

## 🕐 Time & Effort Estimates

* **Simple claims**: 4–8 man‑hours
* **Complex claims**: up to 100–150 man‑hours
* Tasks consuming most time: coverage analysis, fault determination, and quantum (loss) estimation.

| Component                        | Required?      | Notes                                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cost estimate                    | ✔️ Yes         | Compare with policy limits                    |
| Coverage determination           | ✔️ Yes         | Must flag cases with insufficient data        |
| Fault percentage estimation      | ✔️ Ideal       | Or default to 100%                            |
| Loss quantum & reserve estimate  | ✔️ Yes         | Converts to reserve                           |
| Insufficient data trigger        | ✔️ Yes         | Stops flow, flags requirement                 |
| Scoped out: External lookups     | ❌ No (assumed) | Data already validated                        |
| Scoped out: New document uploads | ❌ No           | Only detection of insufficiency included      |
| Scoped out: Fraud check          | ❌ No           | Data assumed truthful                         |
| Scoped in: Human in the loop     | ✔️ Yes         | Final decisions & edge cases guided by humans |

## ✅ Next Steps

* **Data**: team is improving datasets (split-fault cases, better formatting, COIs).
* **Guidance**: internal fault‑estimation guidelines may be shared.
* **Timeline**: evaluation criteria & submission instructions coming within 1 hour.
